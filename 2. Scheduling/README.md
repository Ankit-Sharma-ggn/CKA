# Scheduling

## üìÖ Scheduling in Kubernetes
- Manual scheduling allows you to explicitly specify the node on which a pod should run by setting the nodeName field in the pod definition file. This approach bypasses Kubernetes' default scheduler.

üìå **Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
    nodeName: node02
```

## Daemon Sets

- run one copy of pod on each node of the cluster. 
- use for monitoring and logging solutions.
- kube-proxy is one of the example of daemon set.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
    name: moni-app
spec:
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: moni-app
    template:
        metadata:
            name: moni-app
            lables:
                app: moni-app
        spec:
            containers:
            -  name: moni-app
               image: moni-app

```
- get daemon set 
    `kubetcl get daemonsets`

    `kubetcl describe daemonsets <daemonset-name>`



### üìå Key Points

- **Definition** ‚Äì Pods created directly by kubelets on worker nodes, without involving control‚Äëplane components, are called **static pods**.  
- **Use Case** ‚Äì Commonly used to deploy control‚Äëplane components themselves.  
- **Automatic Creation** ‚Äì Any pod configuration file placed in the kubelet‚Äôs `pod manifest path` is detected and the pod is created on that worker node.  
- **Alternate Method** ‚Äì Specify a kubelet **configuration file** via the `--config` flag and set `staticPodPath` inside that file.  
- **Viewing Kubelet Config** ‚Äì Inspect the active kubelet configuration with:  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl cat kubelet
  ```


## Static Pods
- pods created by kubelets on worker nodes, without involving components from master nodes is called static pods.

- use for deploying control plane components.

- any pod configuration file place at `pod manifest path` in configuration of kubelet service, are created by kubelet on worker nodes.

- Second way, specify `config` in configuration of kubelet service, and define `staticPodPath` in the config file.

- command to check kubelet service config - `sudo systemctl cat kubelet`


## Priority Class

- define priority of workloads within cluster. 

    `kubectl get priorityclass`


```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
    name: high-pr
value: 1000000000
description: "Priority class for crtiical"
globalDefault: true
preemptionPolicy: never
```
- binding the priority class with a pod

    `spec > priorityClassName > <PriorityClass Name>`

- by default a pod will have a default priority class, in which the value of `globalDefault: true`. It can be done for only one priority class only.

- `preemptionPolicy` : policy for scheduling a pod with priority, when there is no resources left on the worker nodes.

    1. never: no schedule pod will be evicted to schedule a pod with higher priority.

    2. PreemptLowerPriority: lower priority pod will be evicted to schedule a higher priority pod in case of resource exhaustion.


## Scheduling Process and Plugin

- Pod scheduling is a process of multiple steps to sort, priortize and bind the pods to noes.

1. Pod Creation: A user or controller creates a pod, and the pod is added to the API server with a Pending status

2. Scheduling Queue: On basis of priority, a queue is created for the pending pods.
    Plugin: PrioritySort

3. Filtering: The scheduler filters out nodes that do not meet the pod's requirements.

    Common filters(plugins) include:
    a. NodeUnschedulable: Excludes nodes marked as unschedulable.
    b. NodeAffinity: Ensures the pod's nodeAffinity rules are satisfied.
    c. TaintToleration: Ensures the pod tolerates the node's taints.
    d. PodTopologySpread: Ensures pods are evenly distributed across failure domains (e.g., zones).

4. Scoring: The scheduler assigns a score to each node that passed the filtering phase. This step is performed by score plugins.
    
    Common scoring criteria include:
    a. LeastAllocated: Prefers nodes with the least allocated resources.
    b. NodeAffinity: Prefers nodes that match the pod's preferredDuringScheduling rules.
    c. PodTopologySpread: Prefers nodes that improve pod distribution.

5. Pod Binding: The scheduler updates the pod's spec.nodeName field to bind it to the selected node.

## Admission Controllers

- Admission controllers are components in Kubernetes that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server after authentication and authorization but before the object is persisted in etcd. They allow you to modify or validate requests before they are applied to the cluster.

- Admission controllers are plugins that enforce policies on objects during their creation, update, or deletion. They can:

    Mutate requests (e.g., add default values, inject sidecars).
    Validate requests (e.g., enforce security policies, resource quotas).

- The list of enabled admission controllers is configured in the Kubernetes API server. To check which admission controllers are enabled, follow these steps:
