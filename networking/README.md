# Networking
 
## Network ports within Cluster

* On worker node
    * kubelet : 10250 (on all the nodes)
    * Services : 30000 - 32767
* On master node
    * kube-api : 6443
    * kube-scheduler : 10259
    * kube-controller-manager : 10257
    * ETCD : 2379

In case of multiple master node, for ETCD connection 2380 connection is required

## Basic Networking - Docker


## Networking Model ( pod level networking)

* Every POD should have an IP address
* Every POD should be able to communicate with every other pod in same node.
* Every POD should able to communicate with every POD on other nodes without NAT.

Network Solution (addon): kubernetes do not provide default networking, we need to add add-ons to support POD networking. i.e flannel, cilium and NSX


### CNI ( Container Network Interface)

CNI is a specification and library for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers. It ensures that containers have the necessary networking capabilities to communicate within a Kubernetes cluster.

* it assign an IP to each container for communication, and remove the IP when conatiner is removed.

* Weavework is one of the networking solution for kubernetes

* list of all CNI plugin :-
    <pre>/opt/cni/bin</pre> - 

* list of CNI in use :-
    <pre>/etc/cni/net.d </pre>

#### Weave (CNI): 
Weave Net is a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that provides a simple, fast, and secure network for Kubernetes clusters. It allows all pods across nodes to communicate with each other as if they were on the same local network â€” no matter which node they're on.

### how it works:-
Weave creates an overlay network across all Kubernetes nodes using a peer-to-peer mesh. It uses VXLAN encapsulation to tunnel pod traffic between nodes.

    * Each node gets a block of IP addresses assigned from a global CIDR (e.g., 10.32.0.0/12).

    * Pods on the node get IPs from this block. Weave keeps a distributed IPAM (IP Address Management) database to avoid collisions.

    * When a pod sends traffic to another pod (on a different node):

    * The packet is intercepted by Weave.

    * It encapsulates the traffic using VXLAN and sends it over the mesh to the correct node.

    * On the destination node, Weave decapsulates and delivers it to the target pod.


## Service Network
* a cluster wide virtual object, span across the nodes in cluster.

* kube-proxy create forwarding rules on each nodes to forward the traffic of service network to particular pod.

    default proxy mode = iptables

<pre> kube-proxy --proxy-mode [userspace | iptables | ipvs ]</pre>


* ip range of the services configured by kube-proxy- 

    <pre> kube-api-server --service-cluster-ip-range ipNet</pre>

* get configured Ip range from cluster 

    <pre> ps aux | grep kube-api-server </pre>

    * default value - 10.0.0.0/24

* IP network for pods and service should not be collide (overlap)

* finding iptables rule created by kube-proxy
    <pre> iptables -L -t nat | grep "name of service"  </pre>

* kube proxy logs
    <pre> "/var/log/kube-proxy.log" </pre>

* type of network services
    * ClusterIP - access within cluster
    * NodePort - accessible outside
